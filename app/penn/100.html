	<p>God accepts Theophila’s prayer, and the poem moves on to canto 3, “The Restauration” — an early modern form of the word “restoration” with the specific sense of something being returned to its original condition. Scrubbed of her sin, Theophila here appears refulgent with “Heav’ns brighter Love,” her body blazoned in language excerpted from amarous poetry and remade to describe God’s purified creation. Her lips are “Rock-rubies, and her Veins wrought Saphyrs show” (3.XXVI, sig. G2v), for instance. In some copies, Benlowes has inserted at various places in the later cantos a famous plate mocking such blazons of feminine beauty by making literal the poet’s figures of speech. Pulled from Charles Sorel’s <em>The Extravagant Shepherd</em> (1654), embedded below, the engraving rends the woman’s cheeks actual roses, her teeth actual pearls, and thus turns her metaphoric beauty to ugliness. By contextualizing his own metaphors for Theophila’s glowing beauty against the mockingly ugly print, Benlowes underscores his purpose: to reproduce divine love, not lust, in language.</p>
