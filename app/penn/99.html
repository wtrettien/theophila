	<p>God accepts Theophila’s prayer, and the poem moves on to Canto 3, “The Restauration” — an early modern form of the word “restoration” with the specific sense of something being returned to its original condition. Scrubbed of her sin, Theophila here appears refulgent with “Heav’ns brighter Love,” her body blazoned in language excerpted from amarous poetry and remade to describe God’s purified creation. Her lips are “Rock-rubies, and her Veins wrought Saphyrs show.” When Benlowes has exhausted that theme, Theophila’s body is stretched to become a temple to house the devout poet’s feast and a harp for his “mosts harmonious Musicks,” a phrase dissected in the etching, where King David playing his harp while Theophila holds the tables of Moses and sings heavenward. In the text, her own italicized speech and the narrator’s voice begin to blend together typographically as her divine song mingles with his own, as you see if you page through this canto. By the end of the Canto and Theophila’s “restauration -- a fantasy of the restored monarch -- the poem begins to enter a more mystical register.</p>
