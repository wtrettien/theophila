	<p>Lacking appropriate metaphors or images, the design of the text, which Benlowes must have overseen, begins to bear more of meaning’s weight, to the extent that some pages, like this one, are overwhelmed with capitals, italics, and exclamation points. Thus the teetering poem, leaning more and more on its typography, sputters to an end. Its narrative has evaporated, leaving a constellation of superlatives, and Theophila abandons the poet, “as vanisht Lightning.” Having set himself the task of singing the song of Theophila’s sacrifice, in the end the narrator, still trapped in his physical body, is only able to “re-act her Part” as “Fleet Joy runs Races through [his] Blood through thousand Veins.”</p>
