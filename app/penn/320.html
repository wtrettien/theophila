	<p>Benlowes likely found the Adam and Eve woodblock by rummaging through his printer Roger Norton’s stockroom. There he also found this woodcut of Queen Elizabeth at prayer. Appearing much later in <em>Theophila</em>, it proleptically links the devout Queen Elizabeth, who “past the Furnace to be more refin’d,” to Theophila and the women who Benlowes implores to imitate her example throughout the poem. Over seventy years old, this block was originally used in Richard and John Day’s <em>A Booke of Christian Prayers</em>, well known today for its elaborate and large narrative borders printed on every page. The image of a Elizabeth at prayer serves as a kind of frontispiece in the editions of 1578 and 1581, as seen in this digital facsimile from Folger Shakespeare Library.</p>

<p>Both woodblocks have a connection to the Barkers, who had a decades-long dispute with the Nortons over certain patents and rights attending the office of the King’s Printer, and it seems likely that Benlowes’ printer Roger Norton had acquired them during his dramatic 1629 raid on the warehouse of the King’s Printer House, when he broke down a wall and removed a large quantity of books and stock.</p>
