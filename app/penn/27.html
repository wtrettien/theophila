	<p>The nature of <em>Theophila</em> — a long, transformative journey — as well as the structure of its cantos suggest Benlowes conceived of it in part as a divine epic. While the tradition of the allegorical travels of the soul toward God stretches back to Dante, Benlowes’ immediate model is clearly Joseph Beaumont’s <em>Psyche, or Loves Mysterie</em>, a 20-canto epic narration of the young woman Psyche’s spiritual journey to Christ. Beaumont was his Essex neighbor; certainly Benlowes would have read his work when it came out in print in 1648, if not earlier in manuscript. The book’s influence is evident in the title — <em>Theophila, or Love’s Sacrifice</em> to <em>Psyche, or Loves Mysterie</em> — in the Neoplatonic figure of the feminized soul, and in the use of Latinate nominatives for each canto, laid out in a prefatory table seen on this page.</p>
	<p>However, whereas Beaumont’s epic maintains a narrative thrust throughout its roughly 30,000 lines, Theophila does not. Its story constantly falters, snagged on myriad distractions as Benlowes digresses on his favorite subjects, from music to the civil wars. In an imaginative reading, Bellamy argues that these narrative failures constitute Benlowes’ comment on the “inadequacy of poetry in exploring mystical realms,” and certainly there is something too this. As mentioned above, much of the work is consumed by the inability of human language to describe the ineffable except through metaphysical paradox, contradictory figures, and eventually even the visual design of typography. When all else fails, the mortal poet-narrator hands the text over to the transcendent Theophila, who can sing more purely.</p>
