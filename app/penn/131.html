	<p>After her consummation with Jesus, Theophila ascends to heaven, a journey depicted in the etching as the author watches, holding the pages of his book. Benlowes attempts to narrate her ascendence in the next canto, “The Representation,” but fails to express the ineffable. “Dwarf-words do limp, do derogate, do scan / Nor Height, nor Depth,” he says, treating the lone text as disabled. “Since Time began / What constitutes a Gnat was ne’re found out by Man. / Dares mortal Slime, with ruder tongue, express What ev’n Celestials do confesse / Is inexpressible?” (XIV-XV, sig. I5r). Theophila reappears and takes over from the fumbling poet, describing her own ascent as she passes from earth to the celestial stars, singing as she goes.</p>
