	<p>The last page of Canto 11 has no catchword, suggesting that at one time this was considered — by the printer, at least — to be the last page of the poem. However, at some point after these segments were already in press, Benlowes decided to add more content — more untitled Latin poems, some short Latin prose, two new cantos on retiring to the countryside, named as cantos 12 and 13.</p>
	<p>In this copy, Canto 13 on “The Pleasure of Retirement” is illustrated with the engraving by Pierre Lombart seen here. It shows Theophila as <em>anima</em> or the ambiguously-gendered muse looking up to the trinity of heaven; beside her is a loose sheet inscribed with the “THEOPHILA’S LOVE SACRIFICE. WRITTEN BY EDW BENLOWES ESQU.” — a early title variant that Benlowes uses in the first cantos of the poem. Based on the evidence of this print, which looks like the frontispiece or a half-title page, it seems likely that at some point he conceived of an octavo, or smaller, version of <em>Theophila</em> and prematurely commissioned this image. Now, he has repurposed the plate in this folio, adding some verses by Collier below to padd out the page.</p>
	<p>While many extant copies of Theophila include this engraving, in books with original bindings it is more commonly placed before a recapitulation of Theophila’s journey to heaven or sometimes in the middle of canto 2, when she is beginning her journey — both positions that make sense, given the general and summative nature of the image. In copies that were rebound in the nineteenth century, though &mdash; as this copy was &mdash; the same plate is often called into service as a frontispiece to canto 13, as it is here, and somewhat incomprehensibly so; Theophila has exited the poem and ascended to heaven by this point. It would seem that nineteenth-century collectors, baffled by the book’s proliferation of misfit plates, favored the structurally coherent system of only inserting images as divisions between cantos rather than Benlowes’ more organic, fanciful approach to book illustration. </p>
