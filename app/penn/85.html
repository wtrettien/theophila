	<p>Now the poem truly begins, and as if to mark that, Benlowes opens by recounting the origins of the world, illustrated with a magnificent, full-page woodcut of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Readers would likely have been familiar with this image: it is the same one, indeed the same block, that drifts in and out of various issues of Bibles printed by Robert Barker beginning as early as 1602. Sometimes it is embedded within a strapwork frame, as seen here, in a digital facsimile provided by Folger Shakespeare Library.</p>

<p>This popular image was copied widely; one amateur needleworker Anne Cornwallis even replicated it on her own Bible’s embroidered cover, now at the Morgan Library. (Click the image to view more information and zoom in on the cover.)

By placing the woodcut here, at the beginning of his poem’s narrative, Benlowes visually and materially roots his divine poetry in a scriptural tradition, encouraging readers to engage with his text as they would their Bibles.</p>
