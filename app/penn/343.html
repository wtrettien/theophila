	<p>The final section returns to <em>Theophila</em> with a Latin translation of canto 7 by Jeremy Collier, followed by more untitled Latin fragments. This final chunk of content — 16 sheets or 64 pages total — is printed on paper stock that is consistently different from the rest of the book, indicating it was completed at a separate time, and it is gathered in simple bifolia rather than quires of three. Perhaps the printer Roger Norton, weary of Benlowes’ constant additions to the project, decided to choose a format more amenable to such accretions. By the time the printing was done, <em>Theophila</em> had swelled from the 121 pages of the original eight cantos to 268 printed pages, more than twice the size of the poem proper, as well as dozens of variable engravings and an unknown quantity of lost music. Benlowes assembled these materials by hand at Brent Hall, as always, inserting plates, hand-correcting printed errors, inscribing dedications to friends, binding the book in his arms, and adding some of his favorite Latin mottos to the cartouche under his portrait, including, of course, “Esse suj voluit monumentum, Et pignus Amoris” — he wanted it to be a monument and pledge to his love.</p>
