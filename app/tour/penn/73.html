	<p>The first canto ends with this pattern poem in the shape of an altar, thereby setting the stage &mdash; in a literal-minded way &mdash; for Theophila’s sacrifice. Part of the deep history of concrete poetry, such shaped verse was not uncommon in the early seventeenth century. Joshua Sylvester’s 1604 translation of Guillaume du Bartas’s <em>Divine Weeks and Works</em> turns dedicatory poems to the muses into altars, for instance, while George Herbert’s <em>The Temple</em> (1633) famously contains two pattern poems, “Easter Wings” and “The Altar,” seen here in a digital facsimile from the Folger Shakespeare Library.</p>
