	<p>Like the poem’s narrative structure, the swelling assemblage of Theophila presents itself to modern readers as incoherence. Benlowes himself understood it differently. In the preliminary materials, including on this page in the preface, he formulates his materialist writing process as a function of his “fancy,” a word meaning something like “imagination”: the mind’s innate capacity to conjure objects that do not have an physical existence or events that never actually happened. It links etymologically to the noun “fantasy,” a fantastical or pleasure-giving mental image, and through this relationship begins to take on an erotic overtone in the seventeenth century, sometimes meaning something more like “desire” or “longing” — a sense still retained in today’s British usage of “fancy” as a verb for a physical attraction. Drawing together these various shades of meaning, Christine Varnado argues that early modern fancy constitutes a kind of queer desire: an insatiable longing for one’s own mental images, a fancy for one’s fantasies. Though infinitely reproducible, such desire is ultimately non-reproductive since it always directs itself toward the imaginary object that the subject lacks — as Benlowes does in <em>Theophila</em>.</p>
