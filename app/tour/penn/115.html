	<p>With Theophila’s “restauration” — a fantasy of the the restored monarchy — established, the poem enters a more mystical register. In canto 4, “The Innamoration,” Theophila takes over the text’s narration, first in a long soliloquy on her infatuation with God’s cleansing light, followed by her “Love-Song,” modeled loosely after the Song of Songs. In Barlow’s etching for this canto, seen here, Theophila battles temptations with a shield and flaming spear. At stanza 61, the poet takes over the text again and Jesus enters, “ a comely Person, clad in white” — her bridegroom. “Give, give me Children, or I die!,”  Theophila cries to Jesus; “Love, rest / Thy Head upon the Pillows of my Breast! / When me Thou shalt impregn’d with Vertues make / A fruitful Eden, All the Frutage take!” Later, in a Crashavian erotic fit, she “lay with flaming Love empierc’t to the Heart: / Wak’t, As She bled, She kist the Dart; / Then sigh’d. Take all as I am, or have! All, All Thou art!” (LXXXIII, sig. I1v).</p>
