	<p>To assess <em>Theophila</em>’s structure only in terms of its narration, though, is to miss much of its generic innovation. Benlowes is as much indebted to Herbert’s <em>The Temple</em>, Richard Crashaw’s <em>Steps to the Temple</em>,  or Robert Aylett’s <em>The Brides Ornament</em> as he is to epics like Beaumont’s <em>Psyche</em>, and the narrative confusion often stems from his interest in the lyrical voice. In particular, he tends to probe the boundary between prayer, song, and lyric verse, freely switching modes of address. While Theophila is outlined like a divine epic, then, each canto reads more like a loosely-linked series of verse portraits of the soul assuming various prayerful positions in relation to God, as Thomas Pestell recognizes in this commendatory poem. We see Theophila her in her humiliation, in her inammoration, in her contemplation and admiration of God’s nature, nouns that echo the titles of Herbert’s lyrics: “The Altar,” “The Sacrifice,” “Judgment,” “Humilitie,” “Affliction.” In such collections, the reader does not track an epic journey across narrative cantos so much as she enters into a textual architecture built to display these portraits of the penitent soul. Thus Herbert’s book is a temple where the reader can overhear the “private ejaculations” of the striving Christian; Crashaw’s book the steps that lead there; and Benlowes’ tome a platform for Theophila’s sacrifice, a tomb for her transfigured ashes. What seems to be <em>Theophila</em>’s narrative failings, then, actually resonate with a particular tradition of thematically-conjoined collections of religious poems popular in the 1630s and 1640s. By infusing the divine epic with these traditions, Theophila structurally mediates multiple traditions.</p>
