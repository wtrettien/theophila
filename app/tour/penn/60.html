	<p>The narrative kernel of <em>Theophila</em> is an eight-canto poem about the heroine’s ascent to heaven. After 46 pages of preliminary poems by Benlowes and commendatory verse by at least 11 of his associates &mdash; marked red in the key below &mdash; it begins here, with “The Prelibation To the Sacrifice.” This preliminary canto ranges over Benlowes’ favorite themes, including music, the militant Christian, and the nature of eternity.</p>
