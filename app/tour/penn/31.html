	<p>In a prefatory poem written “To My Fancie Upon Theophila,” Benlowes instructs his imagination to leave off blazoning false feminine beauty — to “Fly… Beauties arched Brow,” “Evade … peach-bloom Cheek-Decoies,” and “Lock up thine Ears” to “disarm / The Magick of inamoring Charm” — and to instead focus on the higher order of “seraphic love.” There is a double meaning in these lines: he is both shooing his own desires away from physical beauty and instructing his imagination to abandon empty metaphors, since language alone cannot tap into the divine.</p>
