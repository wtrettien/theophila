	At this point, the epic <em>Theophila</em> ends again, this time punctuated with an engraving of a young woman dressed lightly, her hair curled about her ears. She is Wenceslaus Hollar’s “Summer Woman,” from the same series as the woman dressed in furs at the beginning of the book, here set on the page with the letterpress. As with the “Winter Woman,” Benlowes uses Hollar’s bright image as an ironic foil to the poem’s final castigation of unchaste women. On several extant copies, Benlowes has even painted the woman’s lips pink and tattooed her skin with asterisks, upside crescent moons, dots, and other obscure astrological or typographic marks to her forehead and cheeks in ink, as if to annotate her body with the transcendent geometries — figured in Barlow’s etchings for cantos 7 and 8 — that she should be contemplating.</p>
