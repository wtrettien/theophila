	<p>“Avoid exotick Pangs o’the’ Brain,” he continues, “Nor let thy Margent blush a Stain” — meaning keep the margins of his text free of any extravagant annotations — but rather “With artful Method Misc’line sow.” “Miscelline,” literally “mixed seed” (with a pun here on “masculine”), is nearly synonymous with the word “miscellany,” something composed of multiple elements brought together artfully, and in other contemporaneous usages it typically has a negative association, as when Joseph Hall denounces the “miscelline rabble of the prophane,” or Ben Jonson disparages the “misc’line Enterludes” of other writers in his dedication of the 1607 <em>Volpone</em> quarto to Oxford and Cambridge. Here, Benlowes has rendered miscellaneity as desirable and, more precisely, his bespoke, patchwork method of composition as a process of desiring: it feeds the composer’s bottomless craving for an ineffable, intangible God whose enormity can only be glimpsed in this realm through endless material recombinance. Continuing, Benlowes mingles images of mixed writing with eating miscellaneous food:</p>

<p>Mix Balm with Ink; Let thy Salt heal: <br>
Teach Palate various Manna deal.<br>
Have for the Wise strong Sense, deep Truth:<br>
Grand-Sallat of choice Wit for Youth. (sig. B3r)</p>

<p>A pun on “palate” treats the mouth as the “palette” for mixing the divine inks of the text, turning printed words to food, or “Manna” — perhaps another subtle pun on masculinity as meat for his method. The wordplay extends to the typography of the next line, where a long-s on “Wise” — possibly a compositor’s confusion or intentional ambiguity — turns “strong Sense” and “deep Truth” into the poet’s wife and wisdom. Pulling together this various imagery, the final line grows from this mixed seed a “Grand-Sallet of choice Wit,” a “Grand-Sallet” being an early modern salad of greens, fruits, and nuts and more general metaphor for miscellaneity, as discussed in John Evelyn’s <em>Acetaria, a discourse of sallets</em> (1699). Thus the very mixed metaphors mocked by Benlowes’ critics are here placed at the core of his method, demanding of the reader a different relationship to the poem and its material assemblage. By gathering together ever more found plates and printed texts and recycled poems and translations and manuscript additions and music, Theophila is not failing to cohere so much as it is fueling Benlowes’ queer fancy. In so doing, it memorializes for its readers God’s infinite variety and divine love.</p>
