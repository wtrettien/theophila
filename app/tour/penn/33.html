	<p>Printed next to each stanza addressing his fancy is a large decorative initial shaped from naked human bodies. These figures come from an erotic alphabet, the Menschenalphabeten, first designed and published by Nuremberg printmaker Peter Flötner over 100 years earlier. It remains a mystery how <em>Theophila</em>’s printer Roger Norton obtained the woodcuts, as they appear in no other extant books printed by him, nor in any other English book in the years immediately around <em>Theophila</em>’s publication. Most likely they belonged to Benlowes, who may have bought them abroad or secondhand and then lent them to Norton for the project. Taken together with the poem, they infuse the process of reading with a curious sexual magnetism that continually draws the reader’s own desires back to the human body and its various pleasures. This visual aphrodisiac lays the groundwork for the erotics of “love’s sacrifice” and thus heightens the parallels between divine writing and divine longing. But the polysemous nature of the figures as both human bodies and transcendent letters also points to the multiple registers of Benlowes’ work, where his own poetry and and found woodcuts “with artful Method Misc’line sow.” Preposterously gathering together mixed media and moments, Theophila enacts the “restauration” of what otherwise would have been lost.</p>
