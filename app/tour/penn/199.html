	<p>The eight-canto poem <em>Theophila</em> is only one portion of the book <em>Theophila</em>, taking up only 30 sheets of this roughly 79-sheet book. At some point, Benlowes decided to write a ninth canto in Latin, “Recapitulatio,” then translated this into English as “The Recapitulation”; it is tacked after canto 8 in this facing-page translation.</p>
