  <h1>About this Website</h1>
  <p>Marginalia, annotations, and objects left in books tell us how readers engaged with the text. The binding, structure, and size of a book suggest how it was used in daily life. Book historians and bibliographers know how to read this material evidence and have used it to narrate textured histories of reading and writing. How can digital technologies help communicate this scholarship to a broader public? Thinking beyond the facsimile, what would a digital “edition” of a material book, rather than its text, look like?</p>
  <p>These are the questions that motivate this website. <a href="https://lizadaly.com/" target="_blank">Liza Daly</a> built the underlying platform for browsing, annotating, and building tours of digitized books. It is open source and available for reuse under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>; download the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/lizadaly/used-books-reader" target="_blank">https://github.com/lizadaly/used-books-reader</a>. The tour items and annotations on this specific copy of Edward Benlowes&rsquo; <i>Theophila</i> (1652) were written by Whitney Trettien as part of her in-progress book project, <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/cut-copy-paste" target="_blank"><i>Cut/Copy/Paste</i></a>, which takes Benlowes as one of its case studies.</p>
